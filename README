# Metaworkflows-geonetwork-manager

This repo contains code for interacting with a GeoNetwork instance to insert and retrieve metadata for use in metadata-based geoprocessing workflows.

The code is based on the geonetwork-manager java library to interact with GeoNetwork Opensource. 

Its aim is to provide a simple API to create, delete, administer the catalog entries programmatically.

== Status

This library has just been refactored out from a more extensive project. 
The supported operations at the moment are

* insert metadata,
* search metadata,
* retrieve metadata,
* update metadata,
* delete metadata,
* change permissions.
